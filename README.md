## The Digital Epidemic

In this project, our aim is to utilise the SIR (Suspected, Infected and Recovered) mathematical model to adapt and investigate the effect of technology amongst people. Like a disease, a new technology spread as more people get used to it. However, there are more than just these 3 types of people. 


# Methodology

We set out to model the adoption of new technology by:
- Generate stochastic SIR model and compare it to deterministic SIR model.
- Generating a network that models the structure and behaviour of human social networks.
- Using epidemic models, create a new model that effectively simulates how technology spreads.
- Run the model on our network and analyse the results using graph theory.
